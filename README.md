# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
This project gathered valuable data about the differences between Urban, Suburban, and Rural rides. By taking a look at fare totals over time, we're better able to analyze the impact to the business that these three units represent. From there, we're also better able to know where to focus future investments in business growth and driver support.

### Technical Analysis
By performing calculations to find the sum of the data grouped by both "type" and "date", we were able to chart the results in a way that visually demonstrates the impact of each business unit on the organization as a whole.

### Results and Summary
While the Urban rides contribute more to the total revenue, the Rural rides have a higher average fare. This data suggests that the Rural section may be a better opportunity for future investment.

The line graph demonstrates spikes across the board at the end of February. That could be a good indication of additional areas of study. In elimination business-related factors, it could reveal that to be the most lucrative time in rideshare.

## Challenges
In manipulating and pulling data from multiple DataFrames, it took debugging to recognize that some operations are better performed after the data is cleaned and not before.

## Recommendations
Urban rides contribute more to the business as a whole, but have a lower average fare ride. The first ask for additional analysis would be about the Rural market. I would recommend an analysis of the overhead of adding new business and supporting drivers to get a better picture about how much the business makes per ride.
Additionally, an analysis of the current market saturation of both riders and drivers in the Rural market would indicate how much opportunity exists to grow the business in that area.
